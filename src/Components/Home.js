      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <p>
        Schrodinger & Pavlov was established in 2002 to help abused, abandoned,
        and neglected animals. Started on a non-existent budget by two animal
        lovers committed to a no-kill policy, the organization soon became an
        important presence in the South Louisiana area and then beyond. Our
        organization places approximately 1,500 pets in loving homes each year.
        Schrodinger & Pavlov is known statewide for its many unique and
        heart-warming success stories. Every animal that comes into Schrodinger
        & Pavlov's care receives the best routine and specialized veterinary
        care.
